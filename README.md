# csr-creator

This is a cli-based CSR creator that I wrote in go and can be deployed on any system after the app is built.

## Usage
To define default values you can download the settings.toml and set your default values there. It always needs to be in the same directory that you execute the CSR Creator.
If you also want to define a default password you can create a file with the name .password and write the password in there.
